1) Bootstrap a server
   - OOB copy cert chain, and auth tokens for each intermediate CA
   - OOB run curl to obtain agent from the service over TLS using cert chain
   - Install agent
   - Agent generates server public and private key
   - Agent sends hostname and public key and registers with service
